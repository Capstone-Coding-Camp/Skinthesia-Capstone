Blackheads are divided into two main types: blackheads (open comedones) and whiteheads (closed comedones). Blackheads look like black dots on the surface of the skin, while whiteheads are small, white bumps covered in a layer of skin."

Although blackheads are not always inflamed like acne, if not treated properly, they can develop into more serious acne. Blackheads are an early sign of a skin problem called acne vulgaris."
